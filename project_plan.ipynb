        "For insurance companies, setting premiums is a tedious task. A company must anticipate costs to insure a prospective customer by weighing a number of factors associated with said customer against existing customers, while setting a price that earns their business. This can be a tedious task as insurance companies are risking millions of dollars to insure clients that may require more coverage than they pay.\n",

        "However, for customers themselves, choosing an insurance plan is also a stressful task. Prospective insurance buyers risk spending thousands of dollars of their hard-earned money for coverage they may not need. Extensive research and internal, non-publicly disclosed machine learning algorithms already exist for insurance companies to set premiums. However, not as many algorithms exist for consumers to estimate the cost of insurance and select a plan that works best for them.\n",

For the purposes of this project, the developed algorithms are exclusively optimized for automobile insurance for cars, motorcycles, vans, and agricultural vehicles.\n"

The most comprehensive and complete dataset, while also being free and open to download, that I found is the dataset compiled by Lledó and Pavía, which has 30 different factors. There are some drawbacks to this dataset, though, as it relates to this project: it is based on Spanish insurance companies, which set different prices than American companies and use slightly different metrics to predict prices (ei. The dataset has no mention of gender, while American insurance companies are known to set different premiums based on gender). However, the underlying goal of all insurance companies is to set prices that maximize profitability while minimizing risk, making this dataset, especially in consideration of its comprehensiveness, an adequate dataset for this project’s intents and purposes.\n",

Therefore, an accurate classification model must be used for this project. Once data is classified into known factors, regression techniques such as linear regression will then predict an insurance rate based on the known data.\n"
